Blog Posts

## Deployment

In `blog/` just run `npx sst deploy --stage production` to update the production blog

## Misc

This CLI is great for converting mermaid diagrams to SVGs that can then be included in posts https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli.
There's also a way to include them directly in the astro markdown but I couldn't get that to work.
