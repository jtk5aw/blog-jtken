Welcome to my _new blog_ build on Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I did

Well first I left that tag line pretty much intact from the default template. If I end up leaving this up felt fitting to leave it as it was. 

Before this I've had two different blogging solutions, one on github pages and then one on Wordpress using AWS lightsail. The former lasting 
me a few years and two blog posts and the latter lasting me about 3 weeks and a single blog post. Neither of those options gave me enough control 
over how the site looked so that's how I ended up here settling on buildign with Astro. Felt like the best middle ground between performance, 
control, and handling enough of the annoying bits. I have some things I'm hoping to write about soon so I wanted to get something in place for doing that. 

Figured to kick start getting myself to write I would talk about how I ended up deploying this site. If this gets posted I'll write about that here.
