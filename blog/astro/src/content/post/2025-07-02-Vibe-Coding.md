First time fully *vibe coding* something in its truest form and it was actually pretty sweet.
My other mentions of Gen AI have been pretty critical, and I wouldn't say that this experience fully changes that, but it was a very positive one.
I was able to migrate a React website into a React Native app with opencode.
I think I wrote/edited less than 10 lines of code myself to do the whole migration.
The two biggests caveats being: 
* the React Native app had already been fully set up, so all that the agent had to do was convert the web React code to native React code and plug it into the app.
* the webapp itself was tiny coming it at around 517 lines of javascript originally.

But still, not having to lift a finger and getting a full lift and shift from React to React Native is pretty sweet.
And doing it all for just under $8 is wild.
It's crazy to basically just be able to shell out single digits in cash and be able to accomplish something like this.
Had I done this unassisted I would have probably taken twice as long if not longer.


And calling it a lift and shift is a bit of an undersell.
opencode was able to simplify some aspects of the code base.
I was having some issues debugging why state wasn't updating properly using Tanstack Query/React Query (name always changes on me).
Rather than keep digging I kinda threw my hands up and typed out, "hey opencode, can you just fix this and make it cleaner?".
Of course, it said why not and it actually did make it simpler and fixed the bug I was experiencing in the process.
That part of the experience was pretty sweet.

Here are the links to the two opencode sessions I used (if you look closely you'll see the first one just kinda ...
stopped working):
